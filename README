Turgenev is a simple chess engine written in Go. It supports (minimally and
experimentally!) the XBoard protocol so it can be used as an engine for GUIs
like PyChess. All told, it still needs a lot of work.

BUILD

This is intended to build with either of the major Go compilers. The go command
should  work* ('go build', that is), and a makefile is included for gccgo.

* gc doesn't seem to like my new directory structure, so for the time being,
gccgo is the preferred compiler.

INSTALLATION

The build results in a single binary which can be copied wherever.
/usr/local/bin/turgenev would be a natural place for it. 

I've focused exclusively on making this work with PyChess, for which you'll
need to add an entry in its engines.xml (in ~/.config/pychess/engines.xml on
Fedora, for what it's worth). Something like this should do:

<engine binname="/usr/local/bin/turgenev" protocol="cecp" protover="1"></engine>
