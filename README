Turgenev is a simple chess engine written in Go. It supports (minimally and
experimentally!) the XBoard protocol so it can be used as an engine for GUIs
like PyChess.

I originally wrote this program as an exercise while learning Go and have since
used it for experimenting with concurrent programming techniques and Monte Carlo
search algorithms. As such, its design is immature and inconsistent, and I am
aware of this, so don't judge me too harshly. ;-)

BUILD

This is intended to build with either of the major Go compilers. The go command
should just work ('go build', that is), and a makefile is included for gccgo.

INSTALLATION

The build results in a single binary which can be copied wherever.
/usr/local/bin/turgenev would be a natural place for it. 

I've focused exclusively on making this work with PyChess, for which you'll
need to add an entry in its engines.xml (usually in
~/.config/pychess/engines.xml). Something like this should do:

<engine binname="/usr/local/bin/turgenev" protocol="cecp" protover="1"></engine>
